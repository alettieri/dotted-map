#Dotted Map

Vector map. With a little javascript+html+css, this thing can function as a dotted interactive map. 

###How it works:

1. Open the Map-Country-Paths.ai file in Adobe Illustrator.
2. Update the map accordingly.
3. Save as Copy
4. Save to dotted-map.svg
5. Open your favorite console and change to this project directory.
6. From the console command prompt, run: php svg-dotted-map.php

You should now have a updated map-path-data.js file.
